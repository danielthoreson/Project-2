Project two is where we begin to learn low level and basic scripting with gitbash. I followed the directions and did not really have any problems until the very end where I could not figure out the directory for the backup. My first attempt on Project 2 went rather poorly as I was getting several errors when I had to solve some directory issues. I attempted using both Nano and a Linux VM but both were way worse to use than GitBash in my opinion. Learning the commands for getting in and out of vi did prove to be troublesome as well.

The whole project was a great learning experience and really shows how important scripting and github can be. If it wasnt for having such an unorganized file system like I have it could have been much easier.

Code Review (Anthony Enano)
Looking over your code from Project 2, it looked like you covered and understood the concepts well.
I do also remember you helping me out with our initial collaboration to correct some symbol errors that was causing my code to not execute quite right.
Your code formatting was just as we were shown, proper indents when needed.
Not an improvement I would say, but your code did not have a "for loop" block, same as mine, but I do know it was utilized in the backup.sh
